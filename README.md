### Acknowledgements

I used the filteredItems code from [this blog post](http://www.knockmeout.net/2011/04/utility-functions-in-knockoutjs.html) as inspiration for my filteredByName function. This [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/rniemeyer/vdcUA/) was also very helpful. The 'stringStartsWith' utility function I found on [this stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28042344/filter-using-knockoutjs). I adapted a [hamburger menu](https://github.com/ymc-thzi/mobile-menu-hamburger) template from code written by Thomas Zinnbauer.
